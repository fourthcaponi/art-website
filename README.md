# art-website
A website that displays personal art projects of a client. It uses HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, and jQuery. Some of the unique features this website contains are:

* A centered slideshow on the main page that transitions between photos randomly. This is done using [ResponsiveSlides](http://responsiveslides.com/).
* A thumbnail grid to preview photos using Bootstrap's grid function.
* Expandable thumbnails using [Fancy Box](http://fancybox.net/).

This was a personal project to help a friend of mine. It is not a commercial website. To see it in action, please visit [www.libbykimutis.com](http://libbykimutis.com/).
